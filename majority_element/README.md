## Majority Element in Array

**Problem:** Find the element that appears most frequently in an array.

**Efficient Solution:**
- Use a hash map to count occurrences.
- Find the key with the highest count.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n + k)
- Space: O(k)

**Why Efficient?**
- No nested loops.
- Hash map for fast counting.

**Patterns:**
- Frequency counting with hash map.
- Two-pass algorithm.

**Takeaway:**  
Hash maps are powerful for counting and finding max/min in arrays.
